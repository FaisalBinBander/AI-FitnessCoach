# 🏋️ AI Fitness Coach

An AI virtual fitness coach that recognizes workout poses such as squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, and more — built using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and deployed with TensorFlow.js.

## 💡 Features
- Detects fitness poses in real-time
- Works directly in the browser — no installation needed
- Trained with diverse images for better accuracy
- Can be extended with rep counting or scoring features

## 🛠 How It Works
This project uses a custom-trained image classification model from Teachable Machine. The model is exported in TensorFlow.js format and runs in a simple HTML/JS web app that uses your device’s webcam or image uploads to detect workout poses.

## 📦 Files Included
- `model.json` + `weights.bin` – the trained model
- `index.html` – the main web page

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Allow camera access.
4. Start doing poses – the AI coach will identify them in real time.
